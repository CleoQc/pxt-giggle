## Example Usage

### Driving around
To drive forward and back for 2 seconds each:

### Turning, Spinning and Steering
Turning happens around a wheel, it's a nice way of going around an obstacle.
Spinning happens on the spot, useful when drawing
Steering is up to you, you can use it to orbit around a "sun"

### Displaying a rainbow smile for 3 seconds
Because everyone loves rainbows, the Gigglebot can smile at you in rainbow colors. It's so happy it's giggling in colors!

### Using the distance sensor
This piece of code will start the Gigglebot forward when button A is pressed. At all times, the distance sensor displays the distance to an obstacle onto the smile and will stop the Gigglebot if the obstacle is closer than 10 cm.
